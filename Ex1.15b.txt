Our procedure divides a number by three until it becomes smaller than or equal to 0.1.
The angle whose sine we're trying to find can be written like this:

s*3^y for an s not bigger than 0.1

So we have to do the division y times to reach an angle not bigger than 0.1.

our angle, x = s*3^y
log(x) = log(s) + y*log(3)
           |         |
           |         v
           v         multipliers are ignored
           constant, can be ignored
           
that means as our angle y gets bigger, the complexity of calculating its sine grows by log(y)

Hence we have O(log(x)) order of growth.
